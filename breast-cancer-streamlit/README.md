# Breast Cancer Prediction using Streamlit

This is a simple Streamlit web app that predicts whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant based on user input.

## How It Works

- Uses scikit-learn's built-in breast cancer dataset
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Accepts 30 feature inputs from user
- Predicts if tumor is benign or malignant

## Run the App

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Demo Screenshot

You can host it easily using [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
